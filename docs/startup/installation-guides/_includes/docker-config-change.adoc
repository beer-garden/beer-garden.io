Beer Garden needs to tell plugins the hostname of a RabbitMQ broker where they'll listen for messages. This value is set as `BG_PLUGIN_MQ_HOST` in the environment or `--plugin-mq-host` on the command line. The default value in `docker-compose.yml` is `localhost` - this allows containers running outside of the compose network with `--network host` (as in the quickstart) to work. However, running this way is not really appropriate in most cases.

To allow Beer Garden to work in **all** cases you'll need to set this value to something that will resolve to the machine you're currently using. Ideally this will be a fully-qualified name, but an IP address would work as well.

To change the value open `docker-compose.yml` and find the line near the top that says `BG_PLUGIN_MQ_HOST: localhost`. Change "localhost" to whatever value makes sense for your specific setup.

CAUTION: If you intend for plugins to connect to this Beer Garden from a different machine make sure you use a name or IP address that's resolvable from the plugin's perspective.
