Then run this command to start Beer Garden:

[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

That's it! Once that finishes Beer Garden will be running in the background. Point a browser at `http://localhost` and you'll see a message letting you know that Beer Garden couldn't find any systems. That's OK - you're about to add one!
