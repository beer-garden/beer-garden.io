This guide will take you through step-by-step installation instructions for a CentOS box.

TIP: These directions should be relatively universal, but as RHEL/CentOS/Fedora are different operating systems, there might be slight differences.

== Prerequisites

Beer Garden requires connectivity to a MongoDB server as well as a RabbitMQ installation.  Please refer to their installation instructions for detailed installation instructions/configuration. Here, we will just go over the basics.

=== RabbitMQ ===

First, we need to install the rabbitmq-server and the plugins:

[source]
----
sudo yum install -y rabbitmq-server librabbitmq
----

Then we want to start the service:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo service rabbitmq-server start
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
----

We also want to enable the management plugin. This isn't strictly necessary but it makes managing RabbitMQ much easier.

[source]
----
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
----

IMPORTANT: You may see a problem after you do this where `/etc/rabbitmq/enabled_plugins` is not readable. If so, just do the following: `chown rabbitmq.rabbitmq /etc/rabbitmq/enabled_plugins`

Then restart:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo service rabbitmq-server restart
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
----

The management plugin starts a web interface on http://localhost:15672. You can visit that address in a browser to see the management plugin interface. The default username and password are both 'guest'.

NOTE: The management interface is only bound to localhost, so you can only access it from the same machine that's running RabbitMQ.

If you are planning on running these services long-term, you may want to make sure they stay on:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo chkconfig rabbitmq-server on
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
----

==== User Configuration

If you want remote plugins to be able to connect to your Rabbit queue you'll need to use a different user (the default 'guest' user only allows connections from localhost). Add a new user like this:

[source]
----
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user USER PASSWORD
sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags USER administrator
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions beer_garden ".*" ".*" ".*"
----

=== MongoDB ===

First we need to install the mongo packages:

[source]
----
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
----

CAUTION: Don't forget, beer-garden requires version 3.2 or higher.

Next, run the service:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo service mongod start
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl restart mongod
----

Enable the service:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo chkconfig mongod on
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl enable mongod
----

== Installing Beer Garden

CAUTION: We are working on getting a yum repository hosted through https://packagecloud.io/[Package cloud], so hopefully we can point you at a yum repo sometime soon! For now you'll have to download an RPM from our GitHub releases section.

You'll have to download our latest RPM. Then install with yum:

[source]
----
sudo yum install beer-garden
----

All Beer Garden configuration files are located in `/opt/beer-garden/conf`. Feel free to adjust the configuration as necessary. For more information on configuration see link:../../configuration/[Configuring Beer Garden].

Next we just need to start the service and make sure it's running by default:

[source]
.Centos 6
----
sudo service beer-garden start
sudo chkconfig beer-garden on
----

[source]
.Centos 7
----
sudo systemctl enable beer-garden
sudo systemctl start beer-garden
----

Now check to see if it's up: http://{host}:{port}/

=== Adding Local Plugins

Plugins come as .tar.gz files right now.  So get access to the .tar.gz file and put it in the right spot:

[source]
----
cp /tmp/my-plugin-0.0.1.tar.gz /opt/beer-garden/plugins/.
cd /opt/beer-garden/plugins/
tar -zxvf my-plugin-0.0.1.tar.gz
----

Edit any configuration files necessary for the plugin. You can start the new plugin through the GUI:

* Navigate to the beer-garden GUI
* Select Administration -> Systems Management
* Click "Rescan System Directory"
* You should see your plugin appear!
