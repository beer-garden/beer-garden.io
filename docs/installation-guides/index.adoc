There are several different ways to install Beer Garden, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Which one we recommend depends on how you intend to use Beer Garden.

## link:docker/[Docker / Docker Compose]
If you're already familiar with Docker this is the easiest and fastest way to get up and running. If you're not familiar with Docker you should https://www.docker.com[check it out].

## link:python/[Python Packages]
If you don't want to mess with Docker and you already have Python you can install Beer Garden as Python distributions. But be warned: you'll also need to set up RabbitMQ and Mongo yourself.

## link:rhel/[Native Fedora / CentOS / RHEL]
Install using an RPM. Again you'll have to setup RabbitMQ and Mongo yourself.

## link:git/[Development Setup]
This is for developers that want to hack on Beer Garden. Clone the repositories, install dependencies, try things out etc.
