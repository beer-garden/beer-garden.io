Beer Garden needs to inform remote plugins the hostname of the RabbitMQ instance that they should connect to for message. This value is set as the `BG_AMQ_PUBLISH_HOST` in the environment or `amq_publish_host` in config/command-line arguments. By default in the `docker-compose.yml` it will be `rabbitmq`. This will work for containers running on the same network, but if a truly remote plugin exists, you may need to change the value to a resolvable hostname or IP address on the network.

CAUTION: Make sure to use a real IP address and not 'localhost' or '0.0.0.0'.

TIP: You can also use a fully-qualified domain name instead of an IP address.
