This guide will show you how to install Beer Garden for development. When you're done you should be able to make changes to Beer Garden, run the tests, and push up your changes.

== Prerequisites

You will absolutely need these things:

* Python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+. You'll need a full environment (with pip).
* Connectivity to MongoDB 3.2+
* Connectivity to RabbitMQ
* Git, correctly configured to talk to https://github.com[GitHub]

{empty} +
These things are nice to have:

* Some sort of virtualenv setup, virtualenvwrapper is nice
* A Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm)

Installing these is outside the scope of this documentation, so please refer to their installation instructions if you need help with them.

== Install and Setup
=== Clone the Repos
There are two main repositories you'll need: `beer-garden` and `bindings`. Both are part of the {git_group_uri}[beer-garden GitHub group]. Clone them:

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules {git_group_uri}/beer-garden.git
git clone {git_group_uri}/brewtils.git
----

=== Install Dependencies
This is where `virtualenvwrapper` is helpful. Even though there are only two repositories, there are actually four separate projects (beer-garden/bartender, beer-garden/brew-view, beer-garden/bg-utils, and brewtils) that each have their own dependencies. There's a .venv file in each of them, so make a virtualenv for each of them:

[source]
----
mkvirtualenv brewtils
mkvirtualenv bg-utils
mkvirtualenv brew-view
mkvirtualenv bartender
----

Sweet. Now for each of the projects you can install the dependencies:

[source]
----
make deps
----

At this point we need a little sidebar about how beer-garden is structured. Brew-view and Bartender are the two pieces of the application that actually run, and bg-utils and brewtils are libraries. Real quick:

* Brewtils is the library plugin developers use to create plugins. It has things like our models and decorators.
* Bg-utils is our 'internal' library with things that both bartender and brew-view need. It has things like our model-database mappings.
* Brew-view is the REST server that also serves the static frontend.
* Bartender is basically all the application logic.

So, as you can probably guess, bartender and brew-view have a compile-time dependency on bg-utils, and bg-utils has a compile-time dependency on brewtils.

When you ran `make deps` earlier pip grabbed the latest brewtils and bg-utils from GitHub. So if you make changes to those projects they won't actually show up when you run brew-view or bartender. We need to tell our virtualenvs to install those distributions in 'editable' mode. From the beer-garden root directory:

[source]
----
cd bg-utils; pip uninstall -y brewtils; pip install -e ../../brewtils
cd bartender; pip uninstall -y brewtils bg-utils; pip install -e ../../brewtils -e ../bg-utils
cd brew-view; pip uninstall -y brewtils bg-utils; pip install -e ../../brewtils -e ../bg-utils
----

=== Run the Tests
To make sure everything is working you can run the Python tests. Each project has a `Makefile` to help run the tests and more. To generate coverage:

[source]
----
make coverage
----

And you should see all the tests pass.

=== Run the Application
The repositories come with configuration settings that make sense for development (these are in the dev_conf directories), so you should just be able to start the application.

NOTE: Both of these commands will run until you stop them, so you'll either need to use two shells or run them in the background. Use Ctrl-C to kill them.

[source]
----
cd brew-view; bin/app.sh
cd bartender; bin/app.sh
----

You should see logs as the application starts up. Then you can visit http://localhost:2337 to see the application!
