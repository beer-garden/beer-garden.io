= Docker/Docker Compose Installation Guide
:page-layout: docs
:includedir: _includes

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and running Beer Garden using docker. It covers both docker-compose and using the individual docker images.

== Prerequisites

include::{includedir}/docker-prereqs.adoc[]

== Installing via Docker Compose

include::{includedir}/docker-git-clone.adoc[]

In this directory you will see a `docker-compose.yml` file that describes the different components of Beer Garden and how they fit together. Before we can run Beer Garden we need to make one change to the configuration.

TIP: You can checkout all the options for configuration in the link:../../configuration/[Configuration section]

include::{includedir}/docker-config-change.adoc[]

That's it! You've configured Beer Garden!

== Run

include::{includedir}/docker-run-app.adoc[]

== Test your installation
We have a docker image with a very simple plugin you can use to test out your Beer Garden. Run it with this command:

     docker run bgio/example-plugin --bg-host <IP-ADDRESS> --ssl-disabled

Where <IP-ADDRESS> is the same value you used during the configuration file step earlier.

NOTE: The --ssl-disabled is necessary because your brand new Beer Garden
doesn't have a valid server certificate.

== Start a Remote Plugin
If you have a remote plugin, you simply need to start it and point it to the host you just stood up!

== Start a Local Plugin
If you have a local plugin, then this Beer Garden is ready to deploy it. Simply copy your plugin into the `./plugins/` then navigate to `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:2337` then:

1. Click on Administration on the left side of the page
2. Click on System Administration
3. Click Rescan System Directory at the top right of the screen

You should see your plugin appear!

TIP: If your plugin does not appear, be sure to checkout the logs using:
`docker-compose logs -f bartender`

== Stop
Run this command to stop Beer Garden.

     docker-compose down
