To review what's happening here: we added an import `Plugin` at the top of our file and created a standard main method. In that method we created a `HelloWorldClient` object and a `Plugin` object. Notice that when we create the `Plugin` we pass it the client and some additional parameters. Don't worry too much about the additional paramters - we'll cover them later.
