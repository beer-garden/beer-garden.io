= Securing Your Beer Garden
:page-layout: docs

Oh boy. This is a big one. Hold on, it's about to get real.

Please, please, please read and understand Beer Garden architecture before attempting to secure anything. Beer Garden tries to make creating and running plugins as simple as possible, but Beer Garden itself has a fair amount of moving pieces. Understanding what they are and how they fit together is crucial to security.

For this discussion we're going to assume you're not operating Beer Garden behind a reverse proxy.

Ok, here we go.

== TLS
Step one is to use TLS everywhere. If you don't, everything else you do will be a waste of time. This is - by far - the most important thing.

First, you will need a server certificate. How to obtain one is beyond the scope of these instructions, but check out Let's Encrypt if you need guidance. You can also use a self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by an authority not part of the standard Certifi bundle. Again, a discussion of the tradeoffs associated with this is beyond scope. If you do this, Beer Garden assumes that you understand the risks and have made a conscious choice to accept them.

Ok, so you have a server certificate. Great! Now you need to tell Brew-view about it:

[source,yaml]
.brew-view-config.yaml
----
web:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 2337
  ssl:
    ca_cert: null
    ca_path: null
    enabled: true
    private_key: /path/to/the/private/key
    public_key: /path/to/the/public/key
----

Some things to note:
- `enabled` has been set to `true`. This tells Brew-view to operate in secure mode.
- `private_key` and `public_key` have been set to their respective paths.
- `ca_cert` and `ca_path` are null. If you're using a certificate signed by a real Certificate Authority, this is what you want. However, if you're using a certificate signed by some other authority you'll need to specify a cert or path describing that authority (and all intermediates). If you're familiar with `SSLContext`, the values provided will be passed to `load_verify_locations`.

Cool! Now you can use https to connect to Brew-view. Since Bartender makes requests to Brew-view it needs to know how to do that correctly:

[source,yaml]
.bartender-config.yaml
----
web:
  ca_cert: null
  ca_verify: true
  host: localhost
  port: 2337
  ssl_enabled: true
----

Here you can see that `ssl_enabled` has been set to true, `ca_verify` is set to `true`, and `ca_cert` is `null`. Again, these are the correct values for a real certificate. You can use an alternate CA bundle using `ca_cert` or you can disable certificate verification completely (for a self-signed certificate) by setting `ca_verify` to `false`.
