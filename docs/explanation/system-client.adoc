= SystemClient
:page-layout: docs

== Target Instance
If the system referenced by the SystemClient has multiple instances it's recommended to specify the default instance at creation. Then all requests created by that SystemClient will target that instance:

[source,python]
----
echo_client = SystemClient(system_name="echo", default_instance="instance1")
----

It's also possible to dynamically target different instances when creating a request:

[source,python]
----
echo_client = SystemClient(system_name="echo", default_instance= "other_instance")
echo_client.say(message="Hello, World!", _instance_name="instance1")
----

== Blocking / Nonblocking
By default a request made by a SystemClient will block until that request completes.

[source,python]
----
sleep_client = SystemClient(system_name="sleeper")
sleep_request = sleep_client.sleep(amount=10)  # Will block for 10 seconds
----
