Starting in Beer Garden 2.1.0, it is possible to tell your plugins how to log from the Beer Garden application itself. Beer Garden provides a new api (`/api/v1/config/logging`) which will respond with a logging configuration that plugins can optionally use. Checkout our Swagger documentation for the complete details of this new endpoint.

This allows you to do one-time configuration of a logger in Beer Garden configuration files and propagate that logging configuration to all of your plugins. To use it, you simply add the following to your entry point.

[source,python]
----
from brewtils.log import setup_logger

# Your client definition Here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_logger(
        bg_host='localhost',
        bg_port=2337,
        system_name='my_name',
        ca_cert=None,
        client_cert=None,
        ssl_enabled=None,
    )
    # Init your plugin as normal.
----

This tells Beer Garden to setup a root logger based on what is returned from the endpoint at `api/v1/config/logging`. Checkout the link:../../configuration[configuration section] for more information on how to configure this. This is mostly useful for remote plugins.
