<1> Create the client, passing beer-garden connection parameters and the target System name
<2> Create a Request for the 'echo' Command as if you were calling a method

The `SystemClient` is a blocking client that will make a rest request that is formatted correctly and returns a request object. This request object can then be queried the same way you would query a normal request object.

If the system you are using is multi-instanced, you can specify the default instance to use at the system level:

.Default Instance Example
----
client = SystemClient("localhost", 2337, system_name="echo", default_instance="01")

request = client.say(message="Hello, Instance 01!")
----

You can also specify a different instance when creating a Request:

[source%nowrap,python]
----
request = client.say(message="Hello, Instance 02!", _instance_name="02")
