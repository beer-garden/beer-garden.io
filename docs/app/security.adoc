== Authentication and Authorization

Beer Garden supports some basic authentication and authorization features that
allow you to create users and roles for the purposes of access control. This
document will walk through how authentication and authorization work, as well as
the various configuration options.

These features are still in their infancy. As such, user fiendly methods of
configuring the various options do not yet exist in many cases.

== Authorization Basics

Each API endpoint in Beer Garden is protected by a specific permission. A user
attempting to access or modify data through an endpoint will first have to pass
an access check, verifying that they have the required permission for the data
that they are operating on. Details regarding the various permissions and how to
assign them will be provided further on, but this is the basic principal on
which the access control for Beer Garden operates. The Beer Garden UI works by
making appropriate API calls behind the scenes. So too does the brewtils Plugin
and EasyClient code. This means that access control for all aspects of Beer
Garden is done through this permission checking that happens in the API.

== Permissions

Permissions are currently defined around typical CRUD operations for various
entities. That is, for a given entity there is a "create", "read", "update", and
"delete" permission. The current entities that exist are:

* job
* garden
* queue
* request
* system
* user

Permissions are defined as strings of the format "<entity>:<operation>". For
example: `garden:read`, `system:update`, `request:delete`.

There are also a limited number of special permissions that do not map to a
typical entity or operation. These currently include:

* `event:forward` - This permission is required for garden-to-garden
  communications. If your authorization is enabled on your remote gardens, this
  permission must be assigned to the user account that your local garden uses to
  communicate with those remote gardens. 

CAUTION: Regular users should not have the `event:forward` permission, as it
allows for the creation of requests against any garden or system.

== Authentication Basics

When authorization is enabled on your garden, users need a way to authenticate
in order to access the garden using their account. From a user's perspective,
this is done via the following:

== Web UI Access

When authorization is enabled, a "login" button will appear toward the top right
of the page. Clicking this brings up a login box for the user to enter their
credentials and sign in.

== API Access

For direct API access, a user would first send their credentials in a POST to
`/api/v1/token`. This results in an access and refresh token being provided back
in the response. The access token would then be provided by the user in
subsequent API calls via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

This token retrieval and usage is handled for the user by the Web UI and
EasyClient, but both use this API login and access token workflow behind the
scenes.

== Auth Settings

Authorization and authentication settings are housed under a top level `auth`
section of the main application configuration yaml file. Some general information
about the settings is below, but for the full list of configuration options check
out the link:../config_yaml/#auth-authentication_handlers-basic-enabled[configuration guide].

=== Authentication Handlers

This section allows you to configure the ways that users are able to
authenticate to the garden. The available handlers are:

* *basic* 
* *trusted_header*

Basic authentication allows users to login with a username and password.

The trusted headers method allows for users to be authenticated via request
headersthat get set via a trusted proxy. If your garden sits behind a proxy
that will authenticate the user and place their username in a header,
enabling this will tell the garden to use that provided username.

When logging in via the UI, the login dialog will always show the input fields
for username and password. If a user is authenticating by providing certificates
on all requests that go through a proxy, these fields can safely be left blank.
Since the trusted headers will be included on the login request, the user will
still be able to login.

CAUTION: If you enable trusted headers authentication, it is imperative that users
are required to access your garden through the proxy and do not have a means of
accessing the garden directly. Direct garden access could allow users to set
what are supposed to be trusted headers themselves. This would allow
masquerading as whomever they wish.

=== Default Admin Account

A default admin user with the username "admin" and password "password" will be
created when a garden is started for the first time. A superuser role will also
be created and assigned to the admin user. The initial username and password for
this account can be changed via the settings under `auth.default_admin`. After
garden initialization, the password for this account can be changed in the same
manner as any regular user account, via the "Change Password" option in the top
right â˜° menu.

=== Defining Roles

Roles are simply groupings of permissions. Roles can contain whatever
permissions you'd like, though it is generally advisable to construct your roles
around the functionality that different types of users might need in order to
perform their work on the garden.

To define the roles that will be available in your garden, create a yaml file
and set the `auth.role_definition_file` setting to the location of that file.
The format of the file is simply a list of definitions containig a `name` and a
list of `permissions`. Here are some excepts from the example `roles.yaml` file
that you'll find in the link:{bg-github-uri}/example_configs[example configs.]

[source,yaml]
----
- name: "job_manager"
  permissions:
    - "job:create"
    - "job:read"
    - "job:update"
    - "job:delete"

- name: "operator"
  permissions:
    - "garden:read"
    - "request:create"
    - "request:read"
    - "system:read"

- name: "read_only"
  permissions:
    - "job:read"
    - "garden:read"
    - "queue:read"
    - "request:read"
    - "system:read"
----

The available permissions are discussed in the earlier
Permissions section.

=== Assigning Roles

Users are not granted permissions directly. Instead they are assigned roles in a
specific domain, granting them all of the role's permissions in that domain.

A domain is a set of gardens or systems (or the special "Global" domain scope,
which provides universal access). When permissions get checked they follow a
hierarchy, meaning access at the Global level confers access to all gardens and
systems, access for a garden confers access for all systems in that garden, etc.

Users can be assigned roles by logging into Beer Garden with an admin account
and navigating to the Users section found in the Admin menu at the top right.
This is also where you can create new users and reset a user's password.

NOTE: Users will always have access to Requests that they have created, even
without an explicit role assignment. This means that if a user creates a
Request and then later the role granting them access to the Garden or System
of the Request is revoked, the user will still have read access to that
Request.

=== Group Definition File

When using the trusted header authentication handler, it is possible to have the
groups listed in the configured `user_groups_header` mapped to Beer Garden role
assignments. This is done via a group definition file, which looks like the
following:

[source,yaml]
----
- group: GLOBAL_SUPERUSER
  role_assignments:
    - role_name: superuser
      domain:
        scope: Global

- group: DEFAULT_READ_ONLY
  role_assignments:
    - role_name: read_only
      domain:
        scope: Garden
        identifiers:
          name: default

- group: DEFAULT_ECHO_JOB_MANAGER
  role_assignments:
    - role_name: job_manager
      domain:
        scope: System
        identifiers:
          name: echo
          namespace: default
    - role_name: read_only
      domain:
        scope: Garden
        identifiers:
          name: default
----

The example above shows how to define groups and the role assignments that will
be mapped to them. The following is a brief description of each field.

==== group

The name of the assigned group that will be mapped. This is the name that will
appear in the comma separated list of the header defined by
`user_groups_header`.

==== role_assignments

A list of one or more role assignments to assign to users of the group. A role
assignment is defined as:

* *role_name:* The name of the role as defined in the role file that
  `role_definition_file` points to.
* *domain:* A domain is how we define the context in which the user has the
  assigned roles. A domain consists of a scope and some identifiers.
** *scope:* Can be one of _Global_ (universal access), _Garden_ (access
   gardens matching the identifiers), or _System_ (access to systems matching
   the identifiers).
** *identifiers:* How to identify the items of the given scope that the user
   should have access to. For _Global_, no identifiers are needed. _Garden_
   requires a `name` identifier. _System_ requires at least a `name` and 
   `namespace` and can optionally take a `version` as well. Providing fewer
   identifiers results in a broader level of access being granted.

=== Remote Gardens

One very important note about authorization in Beer Garden is that it is only
performed against the local garden. That is, the garden that the user is
directly interacting with. If your garden has a remote garden connected to it,
permissions for that remote garden should be assigned by a role assignment in an
appropriate domain on the local garden.

For instance, if you have a garden named "parent" and a remote garden connected
to it named "child", you could have the following in your group definition file
to assign access to the "child" garden:

[source,yaml]
----
- group: CHILD_ECHO_OPERATOR
  role_assignments:
    - role_name: operator
      domain:
        scope: System
        identifiers:
          name: echo
          namespace: child

- group: CHILD_SUPERUSER
  role_assignments:
    - role_name: superuser
      domain:
        scope: Garden
        identifiers:
          name: child
----

It is important to note that no corresponding groups or users need to exist on
the "child" garden. The remote garden effectively assumes that the local garden
has already performed the necessary authorization checks and treats all
forwarded operations as trusted.

=== Syncing User Permissions

It is possible to sync users, along with their permissions and password, from a
local garden down to all known remote gardens. If your setup has remote gardens,
a "Sync Users" button will present on the User Management page. This will allow
you to initiate a sync that will make the user permission for remote garden
match those of the local user.

NOTE: The sync operation will overwrite any user on the remote garden with a
username matching that of a user on the local garden. This means any roles
that had been assigned on the remote garden will be removed, unless they had
also been assigned on the local garden.

The User Management page will list if a user is fully synced to all remote
gardens. On the individual user page, a breakdown of which specific gardens
are synced is available.
