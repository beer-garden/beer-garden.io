== Example 4: Connecting to External Data sets
:includedir: _includes

For this example we are going to explore connecting to external API's. There are many different ways to accomplish
this task in Python. For our examples we are going to use two additional libraries,
link:https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/[Requests] and
link:https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[xlrd]

Before we start, please ensure these libraries are installed:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
pip install requests
pip install xlrd
----

There are many public data sets available for developers to interact with. One amazing resource is
link:https://catalog.data.gov/dataset[Data.gov]. There is a wide range of data provided by Federal and
State governments. For this example, we are going to use the
link:https://www.ttb.gov/beer/statistics[Beer Statistics]. To accomplish this we must download the XLS
file and then parse it to JSON.

To ensure this guide has continuity, we will be looking at the Number of Brewers by Production Size. This
data set currently has years 2008-2019 available. The Aggregate Data is an interesting dataset, but is
subject to change format once the 2020 data set is released.

Before we can start, we first must understand how to reference each year. This is the basic breakdown
of the download link

    https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/statistics/production_size/<YEAR>_brew_prod_size_ttb_gov.xlsx

A couple things to know before parsing the data. The start line of the statistics does change
but they keep that same naming convention. So we know that the statistics always starts two lines after
`Production Size - CY <YEAR>` and ends one line before `Total`. So we can use that when parsing the Excel
file to our benefit. So let's go ahead and build a basic parser for these statistics.

class BeerStatisticsClient:

    def download_raw_stats(self, year):
        year_statistics_file = requests.get(
            'https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/statistics/production_size/%s_brew_prod_size_ttb_gov.xlsx' % year)
        year_statistics_book = xlrd.open_workbook(file_contents=year_statistics_file.content)
        return year_statistics_book.sheet_by_index(0)

    def parse_sheet(self, sheet):
        start_line = 0
        end_line = 0

        for x in range(0, sheet.nrows):
            if str(sheet.row(x)[0].value).startswith("Production Size - CY"):
                start_line = x + 2
            elif str(sheet.row(x)[0].value) == "Total":
                end_line = x
                break

        raw_statistics = list()

        for x in range(start_line, end_line):
            row = sheet.row(x)
            data = dict()
            data["Barrels (31 Gallons)"] = row[0].value

            # This is additional formatting to ensure all of the data looks good
            # Ctype 0 = empty, if it is empty lets just return zero

            if row[1].ctype == 0:
                data["Number Of Breweries"] = 0
            else:
                data["Number Of Breweries"] = round(row[1].value, 0)

            if row[2].ctype == 0:
                data["Total Barrels"] = 0
            else:
                data["Total Barrels"] = round(row[2].value, 2)

            if row[3].ctype == 0:
                data["Taxable Removals"] = 0
            else:
                data["Taxable Removals"] = round(row[3].value, 2)

            if row[4].ctype == 0:
                data["Total Shipped (Exported)"] = 0
            else:
                data["Total Shipped (Exported)"] = round(row[4].value, 2)

            raw_statistics.append(data)

        return raw_statistics

    def download_year_statistics(self, year):

        sheet = self.download_raw_stats(year)
        data = self.parse_sheet(sheet)
        return data


def main():
    client = BeerStatisticsClient()
    stats = client.download_year_statistics(2019)
    print(stats)

Now that the hard work is done, let's see how we can convert this into a Beer Garden Plugin. We want
to only accept years within the current Year range (2008-2019). We also want to return this back as a JSON
object.

<1> The `output_type` field can be set to HTML, JSON, or STRING. These will alter how the UI renders
the Output Cell
<2> The `type` field limits valid input types to `Integer` types
<3> The `choices` field allows a developer to provide a list of valid input values

Now that everything is ready, let's run this and invoke the command in the UI.

    python beer_statistics_plugin.py

=== Request Form

image::{includedir}/beer-statistics-request.png[Beer Statistics Request]

We can see in the request that we no longer have a free form text field, but a dropdown option with the
year ranges 2008 to 2019.

=== Request Response

image::{includedir}/beer-statistics-response.png[Beer Statistics Request]

In the Output cell the data is parse in JSON format for easy viewing. Just like the HTML output, this can
be converted into the RAW output.

=== Conclusion

This has been a basic example of how you can use Beer Garden to pull a data set and display it to your user.
We would challenge you to try extracting the other data sets on Beer Production, or checkout a different dataset
available through link:https://catalog.data.gov/dataset[Data.gov], or use your own data sets.
