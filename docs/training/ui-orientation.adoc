. Description of Command (Developer Provided)
. Global search of all commands in the table

=== Request

When you want to invoke a command it is done through that commands Request page. Once submitted,
it will be executed through Beer Garden

. The form displayed is generated from the annotations a Developer added to the Command function
. Comments added have no impact to the execution of the Command. The comment will persist with
the request and can be viewed.
. This will clear any input entered into the form
. Executes the request. Once this is clicked the user will be navigated to the Request View page
. If there are multiple instances of the System/Version running, the user can select which one to
execute against.
. This is a preview of the Request object. If you select the gear next to Preview the user can
manually change the values here.

=== Request View

After a Request has been submitted to Beer Garden the user is redirected to the Viewer page for
that request. Here the user can get operational updates on the request.

. The unique identifier associated with the Request. This can also be seen in the URL
. The original Request that was submitted
. Links to any child requests that were generated
. The output of the Request. This can be HTML, JSON, or String
. Current status of the Request
. The original input parameters for the request. (Helpful for debugging child requests)
. Timestamp when the Request object was last updated
. Selecting this will bring the user back to the Request page with the Request Parameters pre-populated
. Any comments that were added during the Request creation

=== Scheduler

The scheduler tool is a multi-page selection process. The user selects the System and Command that
should be scheduled for a future or re-occurring job. After the user creates the template request to
be submitted the user must add the Job trigger information.

. Job name that will be displayed
. Type of trigger that will be utilized. When selected, that tab must be populated.
. If coalescing is enabled for the job and the scheduler sees one or more queued executions
for the job, it will only trigger it once.
. Time in seconds that the job is allowed to miss the the designated run time before being considered to have misfired
. Maximum number of concurrently running instances allowed for this job
. Repeats job on with CRON formatting
. Repeats job on a set time interface for a provided date range (if provided)
