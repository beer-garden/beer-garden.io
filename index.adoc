Imagine if writing composable software services was as easy as writing a class in your favorite language with your favorite text editor. And sharing that class was as easy as running your main method.

__it **can** be.__

That's the main idea behind Beer Garden. So much of software development is tangled in the weeds of standing up services, getting messages from one component to another, creating GUIs, writing documentation, and concurrently supporting multiple versions. We want to change that.

Beer Garden makes it easy to turn your functions into REST interfaces that are ready for production use, and does it in a way that's acessible to anyone that can write a function. It creates all the boilerplate and infrastruction needed to turn that function into a type-safe, discoverble REST interface and an easy-to-use webform-based UI.

If that sounds interesting to you then go ahead and check out the link:docs/quickstart[Quickstart section]!
